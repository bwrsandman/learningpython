    "## Jupyter\n",
    "Project link: http://jupyter.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is an open-source web server framework meant for live coding. It is very good for writing short code snipets, displaying data, equations visualisation. You can mix documentation text with code which can be run inside of the notebook. For example, if you wrote an agorithm or analyzed some data, you could puplish a notebooke or even a paper in Jupyter with all the necessary sections, text, interactive graphs and even code which the reader could run while reading the paper. Jupyter can even be used as a slide show for training or key-note presentations. Here are some [examples online](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter can be locally installed on almost any platform and can be used for blogs, course notes, quick prototyping, colaborations, teaching, presentations, etc. It shines the most as notes accompanied with examples of read code snippets which can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter works with cells. First you write the contents of a cell, then you run them.\n",
    "Cells can be separated into smaller cells if we want to only run a small segment. Dividing up a cell into smaller cells is a form of modularity and is recommeded to avoid code from growing too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, there are four types of cells and they are available in the dropdown on the toolbar or in the (Cell|Cell Type) menu.\n",
    "* Code\n",
    "* Markdown\n",
    "* Raw NBConvert\n",
    "* Heading\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this course, we will only worry about \"Code\" and \"Markdown\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell is small snippet of code which shares a [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science%29) with the whole notebook. The state of variables (their repective values at a certain time) is dependent on the order in which cells were run.\n",
    "You can refer to variables declared in other cells as log as that cell was run.\n",
    "Cells do not run automatically, so keep that in mind if you go back to a cell and add or rename variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a cell with code, there is a \"Run\" button on the toolbar as well as well as a menu option (Cell|Run Cell)\n",
    "These cells are accompanied by the label `In[X]` and `Out[X]` where the `X` can either be blank, `*` or a number. If `X` is blank when it hasn't yet been run. If `X` is `*`, it means this cell is currently running and has not finished or is waiting for another to finish. If `X` is a number, this is the order in which this cell has been executed (e.g. `In[21]` has run after `Out[14]`). If there is no `Out` for an `In`, this just means that there is no result to show. The order is important to consider because the global state could change between runs. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In[1]: x = 5\n",
    "# x is initially set to 5 at time 1.\n",
    "# No result to show because the result is set to\n",
    "# a varible with '='\n",
    "---\n",
    "In[2]: x * 10\n",
    "Out[2]: 50\n",
    "# The global state has x equaling 5 at time 2\n",
    "---\n",
    "In[4]: x * 10\n",
    "Out[4]: 70\n",
    "# Notice that we are at time 4, so the global state\n",
    "# could have changed for x between time 2 and time 4\n",
    "---\n",
    "In[3]: x = 7\n",
    "# Notice that we are at time 3 and we are changing\n",
    "# the state of x which affects In[4]\n",
    "# The order of the cells don't really matter because\n",
    "# they can be run in different orders.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also refer to the results of an `Out[X]` output by using it as a variable (e.g. `x = Out[2]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell is writen in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Markdown is very popular in development for documentation and README files because it combines the simplicity of a text file with the beauty of a rendered document in a way which is very consitant. If you double click on this section, you can see the source code of the markdown file which is rendered which is still pretty readable. You can see where links are, where headers are defined, etc. This is what makes markdown so powerful. While you may be able to more things, if you were do try the same with Word .doc files, pdfs of event HTML, the difficult syntax of the source would get in the way. The power of Markdown is in its simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note on sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind is that Jupyter exists in a session. You can do most things with it that you can do in an editor. You can copy, paste. You can do undo and per section. You can refer to results from other sections. You can refer to files outside of the current notebook. Be aware, though, that your results (Out) are not always permanent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### More\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter framework is very extensible. If the existing tools aren't enough to visualise data (e.g. audio file playback), the jupyter api can be used to define how these data can be visualised using javascript and html. This will likely not be necessary in this course, but there may be some point for which the course will extend jupyter to better represent results.\n",

    "## Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "[Binder](mybinder.org) is an online service for displaying interactive notebooks from [Github](https://www.github.com) inside of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) virtual machines.\n",
    "Using Binder is beneficial because it abstracts away system-specific issues which may be releated to development. Since this course is about learning development and testing skills, it saves time not having to install dependencies, cloning repositories and setting up editors and compilers/interpreters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binder has a tight interation with Github and all the source of this course is available freely on Github. The reason Github was not used directly is that while Github can format Jupyter notebooks very well, these notebooks are not interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker allows for [sandboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security%29) and easy deployment of the required dependencies of the notebooks on Binder. This means that code run inside of Binder will be inside of a minimal virtual machine running Linux and code writen in the course will not be able to affect Binder's servers directly. More broadly, the user does not have to worry about \"breaking\" the course by adding, deleting or modifying files. Since this is a sandbox, nothing can be truely broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One important thing to note** is that a session on Bind is only permanent within the sesssion. This means that once the browser has been closed, all development and changes done on it will be lost forever. Jupyter notebooks allow for downloading of notebooks so it is highly recommended to save a copy of a course after completition by going to **(File|Download as|Notebook (.ipynb))**.\n",
    "The notebook can, of course, be rendered as a pdf and printed."
