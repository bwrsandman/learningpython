    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to control execution. They are comprised of one or more clauses and a body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The first clause must be and is the only one started by an `if` keyword. Another `if` clause marks the beginning of a new and logically separate statement.\n",
    "The `elif` and `else` clause accompany the `if` clause but cannot be used without it.\n",
    "The `else` cannot be used more than once per conditional statment and is the last clause of a conditional statement.\n",
    "A clause line is terminated by the `:` character.\n",
    "Clauses of a statement are run in order, only one clause will be satisfied.\n",
    "If two clauses of the same statement can evaluate to true, only the first will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional statment has an **expression** which is reduced to a boolean variable. Only\n",
    "`if` and `elif` can have an expression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Body\n",
    "\n",
    "Following an clause is a body. A clause must have a body follow it on the following line.\n",
    "A body is incremented by 4 spaces (first character which is not a space on each line must be preceeded by 4 spaces more than number the spaces preceeding the clause).\n",
    "The statements in a body are only executed if their clause is satisfied.\n",
    "A clause body has its own [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science%29).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A one clause conditional statement\n",
    "if 1 == 1:  # \"if\" is the keyword, \"1 == 1\" is the expression which evaluates to True\n",
    "    print(\"one equals one\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "# A two clause conditional statement\n",
    "if x == 1:  # \"if\" is the keyword, \"x == 1\" is the expression\n",
    "    print(\"value of x equals one\")\n",
    "else:  # \"else\" is the keyword, there is no expression\n",
    "    print(\"value of x can equal anything but one\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "# A many clause conditional statement\n",
    "if x == 1:  # \"if\" is the keyword, \"x == 1\" is the expression\n",
    "    print(\"value of x equals one\")\n",
    "elif x == 1:  # \"elif\" is the keyword, \"x == 1\" is the expression\n",
    "    print(\"This can never be run since the first clause would execute\")\n",
    "elif x == 2:  # \"elif\" is the keyword, \"x == 2\" is the expression\n",
    "    print(\"value of x equals two\")\n",
    "elif x == 3:  # \"elif\" is the keyword, \"x == 3\" is the expression\n",
    "    print(\"value of x equals three\")\n",
    "else:  # \"else\" is the keyword, there is no expression\n",
    "    print(\"value of x can equal anything but one to three\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Multiple clauses in different conditional statement\n",
    "if 2 > 1:  # \"if\" is the keyword, \"2 > 1\" is the expression which evaluates to True\n",
    "    print(\"two is larger than one\")\n",
    "if 1 > 1:  # The clause is satisfied and runs because it is a separate from above\n",
    "    print(\"one is larger than one\")\n",
