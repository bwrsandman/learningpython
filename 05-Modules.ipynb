    "[Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), sometimes called libraries, are collections of definitions which can be reused for different purposes.\n",
    "They are bits of reusable code and are at the core of any software writen to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no technical difference between writing a module and writing a script. Instead of running a libary like you would with a script (e.g. `python script_name.py`), you use the `import` keyword inside of python (e.g. `import module_name.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are made by creating a script as a text file ending in \".py\" and inserting definitions and in them. The name of file is the name of the module. Be careful not to use the `-` character in the script filename as this will confuse python which interprets `-` as a minus operator. In general `_` is preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (as with most languages) has a [Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). This library is a collection of modules which are available by default in any python environment. This means that you don't have to write your own implementation of the `print` function or create a module for random functions, you can just `import random`. This allows for a much quicker start to programming. Python has an extensive standard libary compared to many other languages and refers this as their [\"Batteries included\"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#batteries-included-philosophy) philosophy."
