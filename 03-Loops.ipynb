    "Loops are another type of flow control which will repeat their body based on an expression given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are related to conditional statments as they both have clauses, expressions and bodies.\n",
    "In essence, a loop runs code and runs and implied `if expression: jump back to start of body`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with conditional statments the body of a loop as its own scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of loops in python: while loops and for each loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### while loops\n",
    "While loops are the most closely related loops to conditional statments. They are started with a clause started by the `while` keyword, followed by an expression, then a `:` character and a body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression of a while loop is evaluated before the body at each iteration of the loop.\n",
    "If the expression of the while loop is not updated (e.g. variables don't change), then the while\n",
    "loop is run forever. This is typically something to be avoid and is known as an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### for each loop\n",
    "For each loops are the most common loops used in python. They are started with a clause started by the `while` keyword, followed by an iterable expression, then a `:` character and a body. They interate over an iterable list of values (e.g. each value in a list, each character in a string). They are less likely to result in infinite loops as the iterable expression usually have a limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterable expression assigns the next value available to a named variable before each execution of the body. If there is no value left in the iterable, then the expression fails and the body is no exectuted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `continue` and `break` keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "In a loop, the keywords `continue` and `break` can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "`continue` triggers a restart of the loop which will execute the evaluation of the expression again.\n",
    "\n",
    "`break` forces the loop to end and will no longer loop\n",
    "\n",
    "## In case of an infinite loop\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a chance that in the exercises, an inifite loop is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a moderately severe type of bug and it requires a special intervention to stop once it\n",
    "is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Jupyter, you can press the square stop button next to Run or (Kernel|Interrupt) with the cell in question selected to cause the loop to stop."
