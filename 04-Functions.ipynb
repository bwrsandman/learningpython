    "A function is a collection of commands regroupped into a body which run when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a variable, a function is declared with a name and its value it its body. Additionally, a function will also have a parameter list. A function declaration starts with the keyword `def`, followed by its name, a parameter list (which can be empty) in parenthesis. The declaration line ends with the `:` character and should be followed by an indented body. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are often used to retreive values. A function will use the keyword `return` to give a return value to the scope in which it was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function parameter is a variable for which its value can depends on how the function is called (e.g. `def foo(x): return 2 * x` will give different values if it is called with 2 or with 3 (e.g. `foo(2)` returns 4 and `foo(3)` returns 6 due to the different value of the parameter in the body of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function which calls itself is called a [recursive function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science%29) and, like loops, can lead to infinite loops if not breaked out of. Unlike in loops the `continue` and `break` commands do not work, so the way to break out of a recursive function is to prevent it from calling itself with an if statement and the value of a parameter which changes. Any recursive function can be implemented with a loop. There are advantages and disadvantages to using recursive functions instead of loops."
